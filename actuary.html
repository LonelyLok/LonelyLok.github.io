    <h1>Actuary HeHeXd?</h1>
    <p>From my understanding, actuary is a job that use math to measure risk. Please google it if you want to know more about it.</p>
    <h4>Q1. How did you learn about actuary?</h4>
      <p>My friend was studying actuarial science major in college and he told me about actuary.</p>
    <h4>Q2. What make you decide to start becoming an actuary?</h4>
      <p>Um I actually have no intention to become an actuary. And currently my job have zero relation with actuary industry. It just happened that I passed two actuarial exams and that open some entry level job option.</p>
    <h4>Q3. WTF? </h4>
      <p> YEAH XD </p>
    <h4>Q4. You mentioned actuarial exams, what are those? </h4>
      <p> It is some exams that you have to pass in order to become an actual actuary (Like having a title). The more exam you passed, the higher position you can achieve. Number of exams you passed is a factor of getting a actuary job. I have no idea why but that is how it is.</p>
    <h4>Q5. Yo then why you go take those exams when you are not planning to be an actuary?</h4>
      <p> HaHa the reason actually really stupid. My friend was making fun of math major and saying how easy math is compare to actuarial science. He challenge to pass an acturial exam and I accepted the challenge. I want to show him Math > Actuarial Science.<br/>
      And I took the second exam because it seem like most entry level actuarial job require 2 exams minimum to apply so I might as well take another one.</p>
    <h4>Q6. From your experience, how challenging were those exams? </h4>
      <p> Very challenging, maybe I just suck at it haha. I probablay spent 200 hours study for Exam P and about 100 hours study Exam FM.</p>
    <h4>Q7. Could you describe how did you prepare for the exams?</h4>
