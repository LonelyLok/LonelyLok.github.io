  <h1>FAQ 1: Explain the excel macro you made when you was in IQVIA</h1>
  <p>Here is one of my excel macro: Everytime when a specialist was assigned a study, he/she will need to enter some information about the study into a sharepoint tracker.
  Here are some of the information we need to enter:
  <ul style = "list-style-tyle:disc;">
    <li>Study code</li>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>number of unique site</li>
    <li>what site is on hold</li>
    <li>There is more but I forgot</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> In order for the specialist to obtain above information, he/she will need to export a Payee report from IQVIA internal clinical trial management system. The report is an excel spreadsheet.
  It look something like this:</p>
  <img src="https://lonelylok.github.io/pic/e1.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" align ="left"></img>
<p> (Just want to be clear, this is not a real report. The real report will have way more rows and columns, also it has a lot of empty and dup cells)</p>
<br>
<p> As you can see above, there are a lot of information on the report and we don't need all of them. For example, since we are in US, we only monitor the one in the NA/LA region. Also, we would like to split the data based on their country so it looks more organize</p>
<p> The normal way to do this is manually set up filter, delete columns, count how many site. It can be very time consume when there are a lot of site with many duplicate sites.
<p> Since I don't want to do this manually everytime, I wrote a macro which will clean up the report. It turn the report looks something like this:</p>
<img src="https://lonelylok.github.io/pic/e2.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" align ="left"></img>
<p>It deletes non "NA/LA" site, and split data per country</p>
<p>Then, each country has their own sheet and it looks like this:</p>
<img src="https://lonelylok.github.io/pic/e3.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" align ="left"></img>
<br>
<p>I would say before I create this macro, I spend average 5 minutes to find all the information I need for the tracker.
  And with the macro, it took less than a minute. Hence, it saved a lot of time</p>

<p>And here are the demo vba code I wrote for this macro (Just want to be clear this is not the real code I coded back in iqvia, I just created this to show the demo but the idea is the same)</p>
<img src="https://lonelylok.github.io/pic/e4.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" align ="left"></img>

<p></p>
<p> There were more macro but I am too lazy to write all of them here. If you are interested to know more, we can talk about it.</p>
